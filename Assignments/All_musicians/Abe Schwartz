Abe Schwartz (1881–1963) was a well-known klezmer musician of the 1920s.
Schwartz was born outside of Bucharest, Romania, and moved to the United States in 1899.  He soon distinguished himself as a talented arranger and composer of music, as well as a violinist, pianist, and bandleader.
The famous klezmer clarinetist Naftule Brandwein played for a time in Schwartz's ensemble, notably on popular songs like Brandwein's own "Firn Di Mekhutonim Aheym" (Leading the In-Laws Home) and Schwartz's  "Di Grine Kuzine" (The Greenhorn Cousin). These compositions are still played today by klezmer revivalists.
The "Klezmer: Early Yiddish Instrumental Music 1908-1927" album was published in 1996. It is a collection of Phonograph recordings of some of the great masters of Klezmer music from the early XIXth century, among which Abe Schwartz, Jacob Hoffman & the Kandel's Orchestra, the Orchestra Orfeon, Naftule Brandwein, etc.
This section presents some Phonograph recordings of Abe Schwartz's Orchestra between from 1919 until 1946.
