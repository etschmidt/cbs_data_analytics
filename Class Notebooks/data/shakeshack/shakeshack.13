The Morningside Heights location for Shake Shack has finally opened and, in my opinion, it is a very welcomed addition to the neighborhood.  I imagine it will be quite popular once the students move back in for the coming school year.

As usual, this Shake Shack location has a very clean and modern look to it, and it has quite a bit of space.  And the decor is quite nice as well; there is some art work specific to the neighborhood.

The staff was also quite friendly and helpful.  They were willing to answer questions, were knowledgeable about the menu, and seemed to be having a good time.

I ordered a Smoke Shack, cheese fries, and a 50/50.  The Smoke Shack has bacon on it that had just the right amount of crispiness and smokiness.  It was quite delicious and my only complaint is that I wanted more.  The sauce and toppings were all quite tasty.  The cheese fries were also quite good.  The parts of the fries that were exposed were perfectly crispy and the parts that were covered in cheese were perfectly gooey.  It was a nice textural combination with great flavor; who doesn't love cheese and fried potatoes??  The 50/50 is Shake Shack's version of an Arnold Palmer. In other words, it is half lemonade half iced tea.  It had a good flavor and wasn't too sweet, just the way I like it.

Overall this was a great experience. I am glad I got in early and beat the inevitable crowd.  I will certainly be returning to try the other burgers and to grab a shake!
