Every time I go to a Shake Shack, I have a mediocre experience at best. Their burgers are not spectacular, and their shakes are undrinkably thick. 

This experience was so bad that I had to write something. I have a lot of empathy for people who work in customer service so I do my best to be patient. However there is simply no excuse in screwing up an order so badly when you only have maybe ten people at most in line. I believe the staff at this location are either over-worked or under-trained. 

I ordered a chicken shack and a strawberry cookies malted shake. Simple enough. When my order was called, I received a shack burger. It became apparent that they had punched my order in wrong (in hindsight I should have noticed earlier because the cashier was not very attentive and kept asking me to repeat my order, but I don't want to use ableist language so I would like to be flexible on this), which I thought would be easily rectified by simply telling them. So, I informed them that I actually ordered a chicken shack, and they took my receipt and went back to get one. Good enough. 
I waited for a few minutes more (this was after my buzzer had already been called), and they came back with a chicken shack for me. Cool. But then I realized they had forgotten about my shake, so I inquired about it. I could tell they were getting frustrated with me thinking that I was some troublesome customer, but I just wanted my order as I had ordered it and I was trying to be patient. So, another employee came to me and asked for my receipt - which they had already taken and presumably trashed because I never got it back - to which I responded that they took it from me. They were visibly annoyed, asked me what Shake I ordered, and told someone else to make it. Fine. 

I waited almost 10 minutes more, just standing there with my burger in a to go bag (I ordered to dine in), and watched someone work the shake machine for other orders that had come in long after mine. The employees kept talking amongst themselves and pointing at me, to which I assumed they were explaining the situation so I just looked them in the eye. Finally someone made a shake and brought it to me in a huffy manner. It was not the shake I ordered, especially because I did not add whipped cream (the shake given to me had whipped cream).

I informed them and they got upset again but went back and made another shake. I waited almost 10 minutes more. Finally I got my order. 

I will not be returning to Shake Shack ever again.
