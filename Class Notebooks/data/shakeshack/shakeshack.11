I didn't know the craze until I bit into the mushroom sandwich. Yes you heard me...a mushroom sandwich. 

The fries are hot and crispy. The mushroom patty is a portobello mushrooms dipped /covered in panko and fried....and them they add blobs of cheese, fresh vegetables like lettuce, pickle and onion.

The milkshakes are okay. Just make sure not to get it with whip cream. They charge 50Â¢
