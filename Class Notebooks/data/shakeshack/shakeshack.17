So excited for this new uptown Shake Shack! The line to order tonight at 7p was super short, but the wait to pick up the food was sooo long. Took about 15 minutes for the food to be ready, so recommend doing mobile orders to avoid this extra wait. 

The new hot chick'n is pretty good - basically their chicken sandwich but dusted with spices. The fries and shakes were solid as always. The only downside of the visit, besides the wait, was the low amount of cheese sauce we got on our fries - not as generous as the other locations!
