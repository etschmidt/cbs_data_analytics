So this Shake Shack was a surprise for me and I decided to eat here while waiting to meet someone.  I was eating my Chick 'n Shack sandwich and fries, nearly finishing my sandwich when I took a bite and felt something hard.  It turns out there was a bone in my chicken sandwich.  That squicked me out, making me cautious of finishing that sandwich.

I take this bone out and snap a picture, figuring I'll complain to the corporate offices later & try to finish my meal while waiting for my person.  

A staff member comes up and asks "how was everything?"  I told him about finding the bone in my sandwich and showed it to him.  He walks off and then another staff member (perhaps the manager) walks up and asks if I have my receipt.  I give it to him and he says "I'll take this off your bill and get you another meal."  I figured I would only get a replacement sandwich or a credit but I got a replacement meal (sandwich and fries) AND refunded my money.

I have to give 5 stars for the handling of this situation since that was far beyond my expectations of what I thought would happen.  I didn't even have to write any scathing emails or make any phone calls to the corporate headquarters like I'd have to do with most businesses.  Shake Shack May have earned themselves a customer for life at this point.
