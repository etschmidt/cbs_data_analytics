I got soooo hype when I found out they were building a Shake Shack here! I work about 4 blocks away and I'm a die hard fan so I knew I was going to be coming here about once a week at least. While I love the food and love the proximity, I really hate how crowded this location gets. The lines can get really long (although they do move fast), but then it gets so packed inside while you're waiting for your food. Not to mention you can't ever find a seat! You can always avoid this by ordering through the app and picking up though!

What I will say is that there is no burger in NYC better than a Shake Shack burger so even if you have make lines and wait a little longer than usual, it is 100% worth it.
