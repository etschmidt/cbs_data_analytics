I wasn't able to rate on Seamless but I think this is important to share.
Although burgers are tasty the food is always cold. Others have commented on this -see Seamless reviews.
The reason the food is cold is because the burgers are not wrapped. The delivery bag food comes is stapled once at the handle making it possible for not only air to get in but anything else along the way.
I rarely rate but this is a serious SANITARY issue!
I can't believe they are getting away with this. 
I plan to speak to manager and if this isn't fixed ASAP I'm am reporting to Health Dept.
I think others should follow suit. This is outrageous!
