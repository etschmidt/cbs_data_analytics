Everyone kept saying how good shake shack it is but I beg otherwise. Personally, I think it's a bit overpriced. A small burger, fries, and a signature shake are like ~$16 dollars. 

As many have mentioned already, the burger is cold/warm when I received the burger since there is no cover over the burger. As for the shake itself, I find it really watery and greasy (from the whipped cream). If compared to California's In-N-Out burger I would rather prefer In-N-Out. Not like I eat at In-N-Out much but the flavor is better in my personal opinion.

Overall, I wouldn't really spend the $$ for the food here. I don't think it's worth it.
