This is the WORSE! SS in the franchise! The place was absolutely filthy! 

Stopped in on a Friday night (09/21/18), but didn't notice just how grimy the place was until I sat down.  Usually SS has at least one person working the front of the house cleaning tables and sweeping.  NO ONE doing a thing here.  People were eating on top of each other's garbage.  I wrapped up my food to go. 

EVERYTHING WAS WAY TO SALTY! 

I've been going to SS for probably a dozen years ... and I've been to most in the NYC metro area; this one needs a management overall!
