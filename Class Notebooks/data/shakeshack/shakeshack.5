I love raved-about burger chains like In-N-Out and Whataburger. I have heard nonstop positive things about Shake Shack from my out of town friends. Sadly, we do not have any in Kentucky, but during a trip to New York I knew it was finally time to give it a shot. 

  It stays busy, that's for sure. I can't really blame the restaurant for that though, as it sits on a busy street in the West side (along with a billion other locations in Manhattan.) I practically had to stalk someone until I could run over as they were leaving their table. (Tip: some of the other locations have outdoor patios, this one does not.)

   I kept it simple with a single shack burger with fries. The fries were good, nothing special but the burger was actually really good. Although a thin patty, it melts in your mouth along with the cheese and other condiments thrown onto it. I think In-N-Out still wins as best burger joint, but I can totally understand the hype of Shake Shack now!!
