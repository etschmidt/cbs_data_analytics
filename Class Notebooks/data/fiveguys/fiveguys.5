Good burger! Good staff! First time here, asked for no cheese but got cheese. I took it up to one of the staff, and they apologized and fixed it quickly! Good fries too! Today's are from saint Anthony, ID from the crapo brothers. Good too!!! Only complaint is the dining space could have been cleaned (tables) but otherwise I'd highly recommend!
