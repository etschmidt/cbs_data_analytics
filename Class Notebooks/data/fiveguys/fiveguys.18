When Five Guys opened in my neighborhood last year, I knew my diet was in deep trouble.  In a neighborhood where the best food you can get is Pizza place or Chipotle on the nights where I get home too late Five Guys is like shining star in the corner of my eye as I walk out the subway stop.

The problem here is that they give you so much flexibility in adding toppings that it's actually hard to make a decision.  The staff took a little bit of time and it's not as quick as the Five Guys in the Village, but it was nearly 9:30pm so I could excuse that.

When I got home with the burger to share with my wife it hit the spot.  It was one greesy dinner for two busy people but nothing beats a well made burger filled where every bite is nice and cheesy, it was all I could ask for at the end of a long day.  I can worry about hitting the Gym the next day.
