Lovely staff here in my opinion no matter the time you go. I don't indulge often, but when I do, I enjoy. Not a big fan of their regular burgers so I always opt for their single cheeseburger with some A1 sauce and their Cajun fries. Fills me up. The condiments area always look clean. Can't really give my opinion on the cleanliness of the place because I usually just walk in, go straight to the order, wait for my food (while watching them prepare it) and then I'm out the door.
