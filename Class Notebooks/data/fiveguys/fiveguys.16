Five guys normally is a great burger joint, and the food here is good as usual.  Waitstaff however at this one dropped the ball..  Woman who took my order asked me to repeat it five times and still got it wrong, missing the bacon on my cheeseburger which I said five times.  She also failed to make any eye contact, and mumbled.  In my experience, the "guys" and "gals" working at five guys do a great job, but not here in Morningside Heights I guess.
