I've been coming to this Five Guys location for years. I loooove their burgers and the fact that you can customize them and add all kinds of toppings. They always give a ton of fries so I never get anything bigger than the small size. The location is pretty big with plenty of seating and its wheelchair accessible. It's always in order and very clean. I like that you can eat as many peanuts as you want while you're there, they're pretty good. There's also a little section where you can leave love notes/recommendations for the restaurant. Id say its a little on the pricey side but worth it.
