I've been to this Five Guys on Tuesday evenings for the past three weeks while I wait for my son to finish his practice.  As many would agree, the food is great but what struck me is how nice the staff is.  If I'd only been here once, I probably would not have noticed it.  The guy at the counter, the expediter prepping and the cooks all seem to have a genuinely nice disposition that you don't usually see at a fast food place.  Keep up the good work.
