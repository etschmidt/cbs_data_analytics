Whatever drugs they're feeding the staff members here, they should sell them on the market to all restaurants.  I've been here many more  than I have checked in, and I have never been disappointed.

The staff has always been very upbeat and friendly. The food is naturally fresh and awesome given how the restaurant is supposed to work. 

If I could say one thing to improve, I would just say to keep the drinks dispenser full of syrup more often.
