Oh my freaking gosh, this place is so delicious. 

I felt like a super hero fat kid. This place reminds me of In-N-Out Burger, but possibly better. Only thing that needs improvement are the shakes. 

Cajun fries were on point and the burger oh gosh the burger. Super moist, cheese melted on perfectly, bun toasted just right. I wouldn't change one damn thing on how they create their burgers. 

If you grew up to or are a parent/aunt/uncle,etc and watched Sponge Bob, it's like crusty crab burgers. You immediately fall in love after your first bite. 

Yes, it is true. 

This location is clean, busy, has friendly staff, and makes your order quick- which is great.
