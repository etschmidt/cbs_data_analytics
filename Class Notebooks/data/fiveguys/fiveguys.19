The burgers and fries are the best you are going to get in the Columbia university, but this location is hit or miss on not messing up your order.  They have messed up my toppings twice (wrong toppings and lack of toppings that were ordered) which is way too many times.  Yes, I can go back up the cashier and complain everytime but why waste my time?  I would rather just skip this place and tell my friends to as well.  At least I am more satisfied with the mediocre bodega around the corner or even McDonalds remembers what I asked for especially when the order list is right in front of them.
