Five Guys Burgers & Fries 

I ordered the little Bacon cheeseburger, so yummy, perfectly done!! I love that the toppings on the burger are free and while I just go for some mayo and lettuce I like that they're are so many options!! And also to have the name little in front of it this burger is nothing but !! 

Overall a great burger place I got the fries as well because what's a burger without fries but I'm not crazy about their fries, some felt a bit undercooked but not horrible. 

Also the energy in this place!! I love seeing a well oiled machine, the guy who seems to be a supervisor or manager is doing one heck of a job keeping his staff motivated and keeping them doing their best work! 

Wished I would of taken a picture of my burger before eating but it just looked so delicious maybe next time Yelp ! :)
