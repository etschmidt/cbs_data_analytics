It's a burger joint... I appreciate a fresh burger and they keep the choices rather simple (real ingredients that you would put on a burger) but you can customize it your way. You get a ridiculous amount of fries with a regular size order and the large size can feed 3 ppl. Tried the Veggie w/ cheese today, it was very good, almost didn't mist the beef. I can see myself ordering that again the future, but I have no plans to give up on a regular cheeseburger. Good for a franchise burger joint!!
