I literally have nothing negative to say about this place. The staff is always very friendly and efficient. The restaurant is always clean and even when it's packed, I've never had an unpleasant wait. 

Now for the food -- this is one of my favorites, second to Shake Shack. The burgers are perfectly cooked, not too raw, not too well done. I always load my burger with plenty of toppings and they always get it right. The fries are equally as perfect. Whether I get them regular or Cajun, they never let me down. Note: I always get the small fry because they dump an extra scoop in the bag which adds up to a medium. 

The prices are kind of steep, but the fry trick saves you a bit. If you love a great, juicy burger and a pleasant atmosphere, definitely stop by this Five Guys location. They won't let you down.
