A good experience and delicious burger. 
Everyone loves digging at the fries at the bottom of the bag. Well they do the favor of dumping a whole bunch down there in addition to the fries that you ordered. Something about them that is really good, perhaps that they are double fried.  Not to long ago they added milkshakes to round out the meal. 
You can also get creative with the options, for example by adding a burger to the grilled cheese and get a Patty melt. 

And while you wait, snack on the free Peanuts.
