I had such a good experience her today for lunch. Maybe it's because all the students are gone and the staff are just that much happier - but I was greeted with a warm smile and my colleague and I's food was ready in no time flat. I had a double cheese burger and I couldn't have been happier. Top that off with a peanut butter shake - I was basically eating my feelings and my feeling was joy my friends ... Feeling. Joy. 

First time in this joint but having lived in DC for 5 years this franchise has lived up to 5 guys reputation. Definitely worth returning again to dive deep into grease and deliciousness. 

Also it was one of the cleanest 5 guys I've ever been to. I mean usually you see hansel and grettle style peanut drippings all over the place - but someone came out to sweep every 10 minutes it seemed. Top marks!
